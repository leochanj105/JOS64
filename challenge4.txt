Lab4 Challenge 2 completed:
In kern/sched.c, I added a priority scheduling policy, which pick the env with highest priority. 
To choose a specific scheduling policy, change the PRIORITY macro at the top of the file.
Note that this pure priority scheduing may be conflicting with some tasks such as primes.c since
deadlock might occur.
Also in lib/fork.c, I allow each child env to extend the priority of its parent. 
A new system call is also added to change the priority of an env:
sys_change_priority(envid_t id, int priority).
