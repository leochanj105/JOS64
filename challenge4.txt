Lab4 Challenge 2 completed:
In kern/sched.c, I added a priority scheduling policy, which pick the env with highest priority. 
To choose a specific scheduling policy, change the PRIORITY macro at the top of the file.
Note that this pure priority scheduing may be very slow compare to round-robin when there are many envs, since it has to iterate through the whole env list.
Also in lib/fork.c, I allow each child env to extend its parent's priority.
A new system call is also added to change the priority of an env:
sys_change_priority(envid_t id, int priority).
