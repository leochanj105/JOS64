List challenge problems completed as part of the lab 1 handin, as well
as the problem number.

Challenge 1:
In moniter.c, we defined at line 20-28 a group of macros of ANSI escape characters to print different colors.
Also we printed different colors at line 343 with the following statement:
cprintf(RED "RED" GREEN"GREEN"YELLOW"YELLOW"BLUE"BLUE"MAGNETA"MAGNETA"CYAN"CYAN\n" RESET);
This prints a line of different colors and then resets. See kern/monitor.c for the source codes.
